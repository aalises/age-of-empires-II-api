## Disclaimer
The Age of Empires II API was originally conceived as a pet project 6 years ago (...already, phew!). Initially I had it running on Heroku and was working just fine.

As time passed people was using it, paired with good ole' Heroku changing its ways and quotes, we were running out of the free tier hours, so unfortunately I had to shut it down.

Don't have time these days to dedicate to it and I'm not sure if it's still working as intended, so take the project with a pinch of salt! Anyways, feel free to improve it, fork it, self-host it (there's the docker image still dangling around), or do with it whatever you see fit!

Farewell, paladins!

Age of Empires II API created with:
 - `Flask + FlaskRESTful` 
 - `SQLite` (DB)
 - `SQLAlchemy` (ORM)
 - `Flasgger` (Swagger Docs)
 - `Pytest + Coverage` (Tests)

Which allows you to retrieve information about the civilizations, technologies, units and structures of AOE2. To run you can use `Docker`, for example:

```
docker build -t aoe2api:v1 .
docker run --name aoe2api -p 8080:80 -d aoe2api:v1 
```
or pull the image from DockerHub:

```
docker pull aalises/aoe2api:latest
```
The routes are: 
- Main API route: `localhost:8080/api/v1`
- Docs Route: `localhost:8080/docs`

To test using `pytest`, just run

```
python -m pytest
```

For testing the coverage using `coverage` run:

```
coverage run -m pytest
```
